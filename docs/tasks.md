22. [ ] Implement IP address validation and blacklisting for traceroute targets

## Frontend Improvements

### User Interface

23. [ ] Implement responsive design for mobile devices
24. [ ] Add dark/light theme toggle
25. [ ] Improve accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation)
26. [ ] Add loading indicators for traceroute operations
27. [ ] Implement error handling with user-friendly messages
28. [ ] Add tooltips for UI elements to improve usability

### Performance

29. [ ] Optimize Three.js rendering for better performance
30. [ ] Implement lazy loading for visualization components

38. [ ] Add export options (PNG, JSON, CSV) for visualization results
39. [ ] Implement custom visualization themes

## Testing

40. [ ] Increase unit test coverage for backend services
